# Java Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Java learning repository!  
Here, I regularly upload my practice codes and tasks related to:

- ✅ Java Fundamentals  
- 🔄 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)  
- 🔢 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  
- 🧠 Problem-Solving Tasks  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Java (Latest version – e.g., Java 21)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)
- **Build Tool:** No build tool used (simple `.java` files)

## 📁 Project Structure

```

└── README.md

```

## ▶️ How to Run Java Files

> Prerequisites:
> - Java must be installed and configured in your system.
> - IntelliJ IDEA should be installed.

### 🔹 Using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on `Open` and select this repository folder.
3. Navigate to any `.java` file you want to run.
4. Right-click the file → `Run 'FileName.main()'`.

### 🔹 Using Command Line:

1. Navigate to the folder containing your `.java` file:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/file
   ```

2. Compile the Java file:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled file:

   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

## 📚 Purpose

This repo serves as my learning log while I build strong fundamentals in Java and improve my coding problem-solving skills.
I'm consistently adding new topics and problems as I learn.
